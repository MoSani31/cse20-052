                In the 7th century, Dala Hill, a residual hill in Kano, was the site of a hunting and gathering community that engaged in iron work (Nok culture); it is unknown whether these were Hausa people or speakers of Niger–Congo languages. Kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill, and was referred to as such till the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th by Bornoan sources. 
                The Kano Chronicle identifies Barbushe, a warrior priest of Dala Hill and a female spirit deity known as Tsumbura, Barbushe is from the lineage of the hunter family (maparauta) who were the city's first settlers. (Elizabeth Isichei notes that the description of Barbushe is similar to those of Sao people.) While small chiefdoms were previously present in the area, according to the Kano Chronicle, Bagauda son of Bawo and grandson of the mythical hero Bayajidda, became the first king of Kano in 999, reigning until 1063. His grandson Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king, began building city walls (badala/ganuwa) at the foot of Dala Hill. His own son, Tsaraki (1136–1194), the fifth king, completed them during his reign.

        <p>Kano State has always been ethnically cosmopolitan. Although it was one of the seven true Hausa states alongside Zaria, Hadejiya, Daura, Katsina, Gobir, and Rano, it also always has been a centre of culture and commerce in the whole West Africa subregion for hundreds of years, hosting dozens of ethnicities such as Arabs, Nupes, Mandingos, and Zarmas.

            The 19th century Jihad led by Fulani Islamic scholar, Usman Dan Fodio ushered in a minority Fulani rule in the then nation state. British colonialism and amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates of Nigeria, rather than stifle Kano’s historic advancement, fertilized its demographic growth as tribes such as the Tiv, Jukun, Kanuri, Djerma, Tuareg, Shuwa Arab, Ebira, Angas, Kataf, Gbagyi and the Igala moved in.
            
            Most of the tribes mentioned have become fully integrated with the domineering Hausa and Fulani population, and as such have lost most of their outstanding heritage paraphernalia.</p>

            <p> <h2><b>HAUSA</b></h2> The Hausa are the largest ethnic group in Kano State, and all of West Africa. They also have large population in states like Katsina, Jigawa, Zamfara, Kaduna, Bauchi, Kebbi and Gombe; and also countries like Niger Republic, Chad, Ghana, Cameroon and Ivory Coast.

                The Hausa have remained very influential culturally and politically in Kano State, despite loosing the leadership of the state to Fulanis during the Usman Dan Fodio-led Jihad of the 19th century. The Hausa language is the lingua franca in the state. It is used by both natives and non-natives in both formal and informal interactions. The Hausa mode of dressing is also very popular.
                
                The Hausa who are indigenious to Kano and have no other hometown outside Kano are known as the Kanawa. Other Hausa subgroups in Kano State include the Gobirawa, the Zamfarawa, the Kabawa, the Adarawa and the Hadejawa.</p>

        <p><h2><b>FULANI</b></h2> Fulani are a nomadic tribe who have been influential in the politics, economics and histories of West African states for over a thousand years.

            The Fulani played a significant role in the rise and fall of the Mossi states in Burkina Faso, and also contributed to the migratory movements of people southward through Niger and Nigeria into Cameroon.
            
            The Fulani were responsible for introducing and spreading Islam throughout much of western Africa.
            
            The height of the Fulani empire was between the early 1800s and early 1900s. This power was consolidated under Usman Dan Fodio and was centered in Sokoto. Dan Fodio was a devout Muslim who used religious fervour to ignite troops to undertake series of Jihads.
            
            Following the early success of Fulani Islamic warriors, non-Islamic Fulani joined ranks with their fellows to form an extensive and powerful empire across much of northern Nigeria.
            
            Kano was made a province of the powerful Fulani empire headquartered in Sokoto during this period, and the Fulani took over power in what was a Hausa nation-state.</p>

                The Kanuri include several subgroups such as the Ngizmawa and Mangawa, some of whom consider themselves distinct from the Kanuri.
                
                The Kanuri first came to Kano as merchants and scholars centuries ago, when the Kanem-Bornu empire was still in existence.
                
                Today, the Kanuri are everywhere in Kano State, in both rural areas and urban centers.</p>

Galleries include the Zaure or the main entrance hall with displays of traditional materials, city walls and maps of Kano, the history of statehood, Kano in the 19th century, the Civil War, economy, industry and music.
            The house was originally built in the 15th century for Muhammad Rumfa then the young grandchild of the monarch who had just been appointed Makama Kano, a traditional title. Rumfa later became King and moved to a new palace but subsequent Makamas lived in the building. After the British capture of Kano in 1903, the place briefly served as an office for the colonial officers in Kano. The structure was later divided into three parts. One section became a museum ran by the Department of Antiquities, another became a primary school and a third maintained the original intention as a residential building. Gidan Makama is now part of museums under management of the National Commission of Museums and Monuments and one of the old structures depicting traditional Hausa architecture. The structure originally contained mud walls typical of the period but in later years some modern renovation work has taken place.
            The museum is located on Emir Palace road and it is divided into 11 galleries with each containing some aspects of traditional Kanawa artifacts, pictures, musical instruments, handicraft and materials. The galleries are the rooms and courtyards of the old Makamas and depicts the style of a traditional residence of a Kano aristocrat.

            <p><h2><B>ANCIENT KANO CITY WALLS</B></h2> The Ancient Kano City Walls (Hausa: Kofar Na'isa) were ancient defensive walls built to protect the inhabitants of the ancient city of Kano. The wall was initially built from 1095 through 1134 and completed in the middle of the 14th century. The Ancient Kano City Walls were described as "the most impressive monument in West Africa"
                The Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a defensive wall with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (r. 1095–1134), the third king of the Kingdom of Kano in the Kano Chronicle. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century. According to historians, the then General-Governor of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, Fredrick Lugard, wrote in a 1903 report about the Kano Walls that he had “never seen anything like it in Africa” after capturing the ancient city of Kano along with British forces.

        <p><h2><B>DALA HILL</B></h2> 'Dala Hill (also spelled Dutsen Dala) is a hill in Kano, Kano State, Nigeria. It is 534 metres (1,753 ft) high and contains a stairway with 999 steps to the top. In the seventh century, the hill was the site of a community that engaged in iron-working. It was called the Tsumburbura shrine from 700 CE up until the credo's collapse as a result of Islamic dominance later in the 13th century. Kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill.
            The hill is a crucial part of the history of the city of Kano. It is believed that Barbushe, a man of great stature and might who hunted elephants with his stick and carried them on his back to the hill, resided there hundreds of years ago. It said that there, Barbushe built a shrine to worship a deity called Tchumburburai who is believed to have been worshipped by the Hausa people at the time before the arrival of Islam. The only person that was allowed access to the shrine was Barbushe; anyone that entered it without his permission is said to have died tragically. Barbushe never descended from Dalla except on the two days of Idi. When the days drew near, the people that lived in the vicinity of the hill came from all over with animals to sacrifice with the hopes of gaining favor with Tchumburburai.
